## GitHub workflows

GitHub workflows are commonly used in my projects. They are usually added to mid to high development repositories, although newer repositories are usually always generated with YAML linting present via the [:octocat: `V8 Git Template`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Git-Template_V8/)

Workflows are used extensively to test the software and documentation in as many languages as possible, and for as many platforms as possible. Due to automation issues, the extent of this isn't at its peak yet.

For information on usage other workflows in Git, see [:octocat: `Workflows`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Workflows/)
